# Cross-Site-Scripting-Vulnerability-Identifier-using-Burpsuite
This project focuses on setting up the OWASP Juice Shop and using Burp Suite for vulnerability testing. OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally vulnerable web application. To run this website on my browser I installed Docker. Next, to intercept HTTP traffic between my browser and Juice Shop I configured Burp Suite as a proxy. This setup helped me in analyzing and identifying common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

After, Burp Suite is configured, I intercepted and analyzed traffic flowing between the browser and Juice Shop. Later, I tested for XSS vulnerability by inputting a malicious script into Juice Shop’s search bar. Using Burp Suite’s Repeater tool, I modified the requests and resent to assess server responses. This project provided me with hands-on experience in vulnerability detection and exploitation by inspecting HTTP requests and responses.
